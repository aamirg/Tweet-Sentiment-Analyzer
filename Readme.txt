Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Python-
 
This project accesses the Twitter Application Programming Interface(API) using python to retrieve tweets which are then stored as json objects.The tweets are analyzed to estimate the public's perception (the sentiment) of a particular term or phrase and then we also calculate the frequency of terms in a twitter file.

This is a basic program for twitter sentiment analysis and can be modified to find the frequency of certain terms or find sentiment of tweets containing certain terms.

The AFINN-111.txt file contains words and a +ve or-ve score depicting emotion of that term.

The first20.txt contains 20 tweets.
